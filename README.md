# Hi, I am Kosmo CHE

I am a first-year M.Eng CT student at **Xi'an Jiaotong University**, [Shaanxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Big Data Knowledge Engineering](https://bdkelab.xjtu.edu.cn/). Recently my research interests focus on LLM Reasoning in the context of Reinforcement Learning and Test Time Scaling.

I achieved my Bachelor's degree in Intelligent Science and Technology from **Shanghai University**. During that time, I conducted in-depth research on Document Understanding and Inference Acceleration.

If you have any inquiries or are interested in collaboration, please feel free to contact me via email at kosmoche@gmail.com.
